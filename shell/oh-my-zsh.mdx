   - On Debian/Ubuntu:  
     ```bash

     ```
   - On macOS:  
     Zsh comes pre-installed. Update if necessary using Homebrew:  
     ```bash

     ```
   - On Arch Linux:  
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S zsh
     ```

   ```

2. **Plugins**: Add plugins to the `plugins` array in the `~/.zshrc` file. For example:
